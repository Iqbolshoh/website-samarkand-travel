        <p>Samarkand is a city brimming with attractions, with many captivating sites dedicated to its medieval history.
        </p>

        <p>The Registan, Samarkand's most iconic square, showcases three 15th-17th century madrassahs that together form
            a
            stunning architectural enfsemble. The square features the central Ulugbek Madrasah, built in 1420, flanked
            by
            the Sherdor Madrasah (1636) and Tillya-Kari Madrasah (1660). These madrassahs once served as spiritual
            educational institutions for those seeking to study Islam. Each madrasah features cells (living quarters), a
            mosque, and an inner courtyard. Well-preserved to this day, the entire complex is recognized as a UNESCO
            World
            Heritage Site.f</p>

        <p>Majestic Gur-Emir Mausoleum houses the remains of Tamerlane (Amir Timur), a leader renowned for his conquests
            and
            the establishment of a powerful state. Under his rule, Samarkand became the capital and experienced
            significant
            cultural, architectural, and economic growth. Timur initially built the tomb in 1404 for his grandson, but
            after
            his unexpected death in 1405, he was laid to rest there himself, despite his original intention to be buried
            in
            his hometown of Kesh (modern-day Shakhrisabz). The mausoleum also serves as the final resting place for
            Timur's
            sons, Shahrukh and Miran Shah, grandsons Ulugbek and Muhammad Sultan, his teacher Mir Said Baraka, and
            several
            other members of the Timurid dynasty.

            Said Baraka, and several other members of the Timurid dynasty.</p>

        <img src="./img/4.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Bibi-Khanum Mosque, situated near Siab Bazaar, was constructed in 1404 in honor of Amir Timur's beloved wife.
            It
            is said that the ruler personally oversaw the building process. Within the mosque's courtyard stands a large
            stone platform for the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Legend has it that if a childless woman crawls under
            the
            stand, she may become pregnant.</p>

        <p>Shahi Zinda is a distinctive medieval necropolis adorned in blue hues. Along a narrow, elongated street lie
            the
            mausoleums of prominent Samarkand residents from the 11th to 15th centuries. To reach the necropolis,
            visitors
            must ascend a flight of stairs. It is believed that those who count the same number of steps going up and
            coming
            down are fortunate individuals whose wishes will come true.</p>

        <p>Ulugbek Observatory, discovered during archaeological excavations in 1908, is the remnant of a three-story,
            cylindrical observatory dating back to 1420. Excavations unearthed a unique measuring instrument, a sextant,
            which was used to determine the altitude of the sun and stars. The observatory was led by Ulugbek, Amir
            Timur's
            grandson. Today, the foundation and the layout of the observatory's rooms have been reconstructed.</p>

        <p>Saint Daniel's Tomb (Mausoleum of Khoja Daniyar) is a remarkable site frequented by followers of Islam,
            Orthodoxy, and Judaism. According to legend, the biblical prophet Daniel (Daniyar) is buried here, while a
            more
            plausible version suggests the tomb belongs to Khoja Daniyar, an associate of Prophet Muhammad's cousin.
            Regardless, hundreds of pilgrims from the three faiths visit daily. A holy spring flows near the grave, and
            many
            claim to have experienced healing after drinking its water. Additionally, a pistachio tree stands at the
            mausoleum's entrance. Although it had been dry for almost half a century, it bloomed after Patriarch Alexy
            II's
            visit in 1996 and continues to flower annually.</p>

        <p>Afrosiab, a site within modern Samarkand, was first mentioned in written records in the 8th century BC.
            Archaeological excavations conducted in the late 19th century unearthed numerous artifacts dating back to
            the
            8th century BC, as well as later findings that shed light on Samarkand's medieval history. For instance, the
            ruins of a 9th-century Samanid palace were discovered here, though they have not survived to the present
            day.
            All ancient artifacts found during the excavations are now housed in a museum bearing the same name.</p>

        <p>Rukhabad Mausoleum, situated near Gur-Emir, was constructed by Tamerlane in 1390. It is the final resting
            place
            of Burhaneddin Sagarji Sheikh, and the site is considered sacred. Tamerlane himself would always dismount
            from
            his horse when passing by.</p>

        <p>Hazrat Khizr Mosque was reconstructed in the 19th century, replacing the one destroyed in the 13th century.
            The
            original mosque on this site dates back to the 8th century. Thanks to preserved drawings found in archives,
            the
            modern mosque faithfully replicates the original structure. In 2016, Islam Karimov, the first president of
            Uzbekistan and a Samarkand native, was buried on the mosque's grounds.</p>

        <p>Built in 1911, the Cathedral of St. Alexis of Moscow in Samarkand is the second-largest Orthodox church in
            Uzbekistan, surpassed only by the Tashkent Cathedral. The cathedral closed in the 1920s but was returned to
            the
            faithful 70 years later. In 1996, His Holiness Alexis II, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, consecrated
            the
            cathedral.</p>

        <p>Holy Protection Cathedral in Samarkand is the city's oldest functioning church, built in 1903 and originally
            named the Church of the Ascension. Constructed in the classical traditions of Russian church-building, it
            features a cross-dome design. In the 1970s, the church received cathedral status, although services were not
            held there. The building was returned to the faithful in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>At the Samarkand-Bukhara Silk Carpets Factory (also referred to as Hudjum), you'll discover the age-old
            traditions of carpet weaving, learn how threads are dyed with natural colors, and explore the creation of
