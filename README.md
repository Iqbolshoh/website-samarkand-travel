### HTML

1. **Doctype and Structure**: The structure is good. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements are correctly used.

2. **Meta Tags**: You’ve included the necessary meta tags for character set and viewport, which is great for responsiveness.

3. **Links**: The links to CSS and external fonts are correct. Just make sure the paths to images and CSS files are accurate.

4. **Header and Navigation**:
   - The header and navigation are clear and well-organized. Ensure the IDs used in the navigation links correspond to the sections they refer to.

5. **Content**:
   - The content is informative and structured logically. 
   - Remove duplicate paragraphs to avoid redundancy, especially in the History section.

6. **Image Alt Text**: Make sure each image has a meaningful `alt` attribute to enhance accessibility and SEO.

7. **Footer**: It’s correctly placed and includes a copyright notice.

### CSS

1. **Basic Styles**:
   - Your base styles look good for larger screens. You use the `Roboto` font family, which is clean and readable.

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Consider adding media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes. This will improve the user experience on mobile devices.

3. **Header Navigation**:
   - The `header nav a:hover` selector appears incomplete. Ensure it includes style properties like `color` or `background-color` to enhance the hover effect.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure that text contrasts well with the background color to maintain readability.

5. **CSS File**:
   - It looks like the CSS code is partially included. Ensure the file is complete and saved correctly.
